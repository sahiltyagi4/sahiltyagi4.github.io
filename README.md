# Researcher

### [Demo Website](https://sahiltyagi4.github.io/)

A clean, single column, monospace resume template built for jekyll

### Installation

Simply fork the repository and edit away.

#### Installation via remote themes

* Just setting `remote_theme: ankitsultana/researcher@gem` in `_config.yml` should work. Although in that case, I am not sure how
you would build your site locally for testing. If you know how, open up an issue and let me know.
* For more info, [refer this](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/).

* You can remove/customize the footer as you like by setting the
appropriate variables in `_config.yml`

* (New in v1.2.0) You can add institute logo at the top, by setting `ins_logo` in `_config.yml`. If you want
to adjust the logo's size, try setting `max-height` in `#ins-logo` in file `./_sass/_style.scss` to the desired
value
