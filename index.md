## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sahil_pic.jpg">

> **I will graduate soon and currently surfing the job market for full-time research positions.**

Hello! I'm Sahil (pronounced as 'saa-hill'), a grad student in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering (majoring in Computer Engineering) at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering of Indiana University Bloomington (IUB).

A systems researcher working at the intersection of Cloud Computing, Big Data, Distributed systems and AI/ML. Currently, my research focuses on building efficient computation and communication models to scale AI/ML from edge to cloud and HPC (working on topics like distributed ML training, federated learning, gradient compression, stream processing, differential privacy, etc.).

Outside of research, I'm also an amateur photographer mainly shooting wildlife and space. [Here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/200009325@N03/) are some of my pictures.
